            <p class="description">On April 1, 2001, Tanjay City became an official city in the Philippines, but history goes a long way further. Tanjay holds much ancient history for the land being a hub for trade and travel have found artifacts dating back to 200-500 AD. In more recent history the Tanjay mission was founded in 1580 and became a full-fledged parish shortly after in 1589. Tanjay is the oldest Catholic parish on the Oriental coasts. Tanjay Cityâ€™s history is closely tied to the Catholic parish that takes the name of the city (Tanjay Parish), and many of their festivals and holidays are tied closely to the Christian faith.</p>
